# 
# I admit, it sounds like a terrific idea, I was all to tired to '"+yy' and
# stuff. But since I turned this on, I was having a different kind of problem.
# 
# Before the switch I'd copy something from a web page, and then do e.g.
# 'cib<Apple>V' to replace content of a block with whatever I copied.  Now it no
# longer works. As soon as you 'cib' the content of the block replaces your
# clipboard content, so you end up pasting it all back, duh! :)
# 
# And to add insult to the injury, whatever you copied is not on the yank ring history.
# 
# So... I'm still trying to make use of this as I'm all to tired of '"+y', but I
# decided to make this configurable, as not everyone might want to invest the time
# to rewire muscle memory ;)
