# Installing Mac

## What and Why

This is a step by step guide which was written by me for myself mostly, with
the intent to use and update it whenever I install a new mac.

    Note: Those instructions were last applied on a fresh Mountain Lion MacBook Pro.

## Postfix

If you upgraded from Lion your Postfix config is most probably broken.
The upgrade changes /etc/postfix/main.cf to point to a new set of postfix
directories but leaves the old directories at their old place.

> Note: I expect ML upgrade process to be soon fixed to handle this so at some
> point in time those steps should become unnecessary

to verify the new directory locations:

    ls /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool
    ls /Library/Server/Mail/Data/mta

check the old directory locations:

    ls /var/spool/postfix
    ls /var/lib/postfix

Lets move the directories to their new place (if needed):

    sudo mkdir -p /Library/Server/Mail/Data
    sudo mv /var/spool/postfix /Library/Server/Mail/Data/spool
    sudo mv /var/lib/postfix /Library/Server/Mail/Data/mta

Start the Postfix daemon

    sudo postfix set-permissions
    sudo postfix start

`set-permissions` might complain about missing man pages. the problem is that
the new `postfix-files` file has the man pages with `.gz` extension, but they
were not compressed during the upgrade.

To fix:

    d=/usr/share/man;grep manpage_directory /etc/postfix/postfix-files | cut -d/ -f2- | cut -d: -f1 | grep '\.gz$' | while read f; do echo $f;[ ! -e "$d/$f" -a -e "$d/${f%.gz}" ] && sudo gzip -9v "$d/${f%.gz}";done
    sudo postfix set-permissions

Then you also might have the following problem:

> postfix/postfix-script: warning: group or other writable: /Library/Server/Mail/Data/mta

To fix edit /etc/postfix/postfix-files:

    sudo vim /etc/postfix/postfix-files

find the line

    $data_directory:d:$mail_owner:-:770:uc

and change 770 to 750. then set-persmissions again and verify:

    sudo postfix set-permissions
    sudo postfix check

[top](#top)<a name=zsh></a>
## ZSH

    brew install zsh zsh-completions

    git clone git@github.com:astrails/dotzsh .zsh
    ln -sfn .zsh/zshrc .zshrc

    echo /usr/local/bin/zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
    chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh

    # edit /etc/paths and move /usr/local/bin to the 1st line
    # also add /usr/local/sbin just as the 2nd line
    vim /etc/paths

[top](#top)<a name=inconsolata></a>
## [Fonts](#fonts)

- wget http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/Inconsolata.otf -O /Library/Fonts/Inconsolata.otf
- wget https://gist.github.com/raw/1595572/Inconsolata-dz-Powerline.otf -O /Library/Fonts/Inconsolata-dz-Powerline.otf
- wget https://gist.github.com/raw/1595572/Menlo-Powerline.otf -O /Library/Fonts/Menlo-Powerline.otf
- wget https://gist.github.com/raw/1595572/mensch-Powerline.otf -O /Library/Fonts/mensch-Powerline.otf


[top](#top)<a name=dotfiles></a>
## Dot files

Fork http://github.com/astrails/dotfiles and make changes to suite your needs.
You must edit user-gitconfig.

Then:

    cd ~
    git clone YOUR_FORK_LOCATION .dot
    cd .dot
    make install

This will install the following:

* ~/.local-after.vim
* ~/.zsh/local
* /etc/gitconfig
* ~/.gitconfig

[top](#top)<a name=gitconfig></a>
### Gitconfig

Homebrew's git system file is not quite properly set. it points to version
install dir and not to /usr/local/etc. we will need to link it every git install/upgrade:

First note the path of the system gitconfig file:

    git config --system -l

Link to /etc (use the path from previous command). e.g.:

    # for older versions of git this will be something like
    sudo ln -sfn /etc/gitconfig /usr/local/Cellar/git/1.7.11.4/etc/

    # for the newer ones:
    sudo ln -sfn /etc/gitconfig /usr/local/etc/


Verify it works:

    git lga

> NOTE: in older versions of brew git system config directory was inside the
> brew's Cellar, so you had to re-do this every time you installed a new
> version of git. The latest versions though, use /usr/local/etc/gitconfig
> instead, so you only need to do it once.

[top](#top)<a name=ssh></a>
## SSH

Copy your `~/.ssh` directory over from the old system or backup.

## SSH (new system / user)

Generate ssh keys:

    ssh-keygen -t dsa

[top](#top)<a name=dotvim></a>
## Dotvim

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/astrails/dotvim.git .vim
    ln -sfn .vim/vimrc .vimrc

    cd .vim
    make install


[top](#top)<a name=rvm></a>
## RVM

    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | sudo bash -s stable

After the install go to Preferences and add your user to the rvm group. Logout
and re-login. now you are able to run rvm commands.

    brew install libksba

    rvm install ruby

    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew install apple-gcc42

    rvm install 1.9.2

    CFLAGS="-I/opt/X11/include" rvm install 1.8.7


[top](#top)<a name=heroku></a>
## Heroku

Copy `~/.heroku/accounts` from the old machine.

Then:

    gem install heroku
    heroku plugins:install git://github.com/ddollar/heroku-accounts.git

Verify by running

    heroku accounts

[top](#top)<a name=nodejs></a>
## Nodejs

We will use NVM to install node:

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/creationix/nvm.git .nvm

Open new terminal so that nvm config will load (handled by dotfiles/zsh-local).

Then:

    nvm install v0.8.6
    nvm alias default v0.8.6

Open new terminal again and verify that `node` works.

Now we need to install a couple of npm modules:

    npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install -g js2coffee

[top](#top)<a name=backblaze></a>
## Backblaze

Download and install Backblaze from [backblaze.com](http://backblaze.com/).

Start backblaze.

Select Transfer Backup State from the Backblaze Menu Icon and follow the steps.

### Time Machine

Its important to add backblaze directory to timemachine exclusions list

    sudo tmutil addexclusion -p /Library/Backblaze.bzpkg

[top](#top)<a name=scansnap></a>
## ScanSnap

- Download [ScanSnap Manager](http://scansnap.fujitsu.com/g-support/en/)
  
  Need to install original software and latest update.
